## Overview

This project simulates the experience of flying an airplane over a simple, procedurally generated city. It features a 3D environment rendered using Three.js via the React Three Fiber library, providing an interactive way to explore the virtual skies.

Users are presented with a start screen, a pause menu, and a modal explaining the controls. The plane can be controlled using either keyboard inputs or on-screen touch controls (joysticks and dedicated buttons), making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The interface also includes a dark/light theme toggle.

This project was built as part of a personal challenge, "30 Days of Vibe Coding," leveraging AI assistance for code generation, debugging, and concept refinement.
